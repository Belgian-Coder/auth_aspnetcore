This sample application uses this authorization scheme:

The corresponding xacml for the PDP can be found in file permissions.xml

The application has 3 types of users:

	- Administrator
	- Customer service collaborator
	- Sales collaborator

The idea is that an administrator has all permissions, a person form the customer service dept. can only read tickets and a sales person can create / modify tickets.


Resource	Operation		Admin		Sales		Customer Service

Tickets		read			X			X			X
Tickets		create			X			X
Tickets		update			X			X
Tickets		delete			X			X


Another permission is only granted to administrators (permision-125)
